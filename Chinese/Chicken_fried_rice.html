    <p>1. If you don’t have leftover rice, cook 2 cups (400g) of jasmine rice. Wash it two or three times. Add the same amount of water (or a little bit less) to the bowl. Pop it into a rice cooker. Press the “pressure cook” button.

2. Once cooked, spread it on a tray and let it cool completely before using. (After the moisture has evaporated, it will become dry and less sticky, it will be a lot easier to stir-fry.)
