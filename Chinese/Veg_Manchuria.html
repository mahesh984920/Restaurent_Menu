        A Manchurian is one of the most popular Indo-Chinese dishes in India. Manchurian Gravy pairs equally good with a simple noodle dish or even a flavorful fried rice. This post has the recipe of a Veg Manchurian Gravy, which is simply crispy fried mixed vegetable balls in a sweet, spicy, tangy, umami manchurian gravy or sauce. Try it, as I’m sure once you make it at home, you’ll forget the ones served at restaurants.
