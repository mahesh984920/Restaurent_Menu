    <p>This restaurant style Vegetable Biryani was first posted more than a decade back. That time, I would always make the Hyderabadi Veg Biryani or my mom’s version of the biryani at home. But since the time I’ve started making this particular recipe too, I haven’t stopped.

        Usually in most restaurants, they do not make biryanis the way it is traditionally made, that is assembling the rice and gravy layers and cooking these in a tightly sealed pot. The vegetable gravy is prepped ahead and then lightly mixed with seasoned basmati rice and served.
        
        But some restaurants do serve the real traditional biryani. This particular recipe has similar tastes and flavors with the biryanis served in such restaurants where authentic conventional food is served.
        
        I have experimented and tried many variations of a Vegetable Biryani. After I came across this recipe in Nita Mehta’s cookbook, ‘Taste of Amritsar – Vegetarian,’ I gave it a try and loosely adapted the recipe to suit our taste buds. What I liked in the recipe was the use of freshly ground biryani masala.
        
        Also, there were no tomatoes, chilies or turmeric in this version. Three ingredients that I always end up using in my cooking. I was of the thought process that a biryani without the inclusion of these three ingredients is not possible. But I had an incorrect assumption and this recipe proved it wrong.
        
        One of the most delicious biryanis I’ve made is this truly restaurant-style version. The vegetable gravy isn’t as moist as homemade biryanis tend to be, but rather slightly dry like what you’d find in restaurants. Additionally, this biryani isn’t very spicy; instead, it carries a gentle touch of sweetness.
        
        The flavors of the freshly ground biryani masala as well as the caramelized/browned onions are a hallmark of this Vegetable Biryani and bring out the best in the whole dish. Yes, birista or caramelized browned onions is used in this recipe.</p>
